# Ship Standards

EXTERIOR:

`Primary Ship HC:`
Black Pattern Plastic
- Black is the main colour, plastic is light and cheap, pattern gives depth.

`Secondary Ship HC:`
Matte White Plastic
- Used as a complement to black to show depth, detail. Much less common than black. Used to showcase 'underbelly' of the ship.

Aged Gray Pattern Plastic
- Used in combination with black plastic to show lines and patterns on flat surfaces. Can also be applied to showcase lines/patterns on the white plastic.

`Colour Accent HC:`
Aged Purple Pattern Plastic (Cold) 
- Replicating the purple colour of old Madis, matte to not compete with gold. Used as an 'interior' honeycomb, where gaps in the solid black frame show purple insides. Think black skin and purple flesh underneath.

`Luxury Accent HC:`
Glossy Gold
- Used very sparingly to amplify or show luxury/wealth, glossy to stand out.

`Luminescent HC:`
Luminescent Dim Glass
- Used to showcase numbers, names, tips of sharp corners etc. Used very sparingly because it screws up the lighting. Dim glass so as to not overpower the design.
