# Static Core Naming Convention

## Org Codes: (at the beginning of name)
- Start core name with `[MTI]` if it is an Org core

## Planet/Location: after org codes
- Alioth, Thades, Madis etc.
- For moons, write AliothM1, AliothM4, MadisM1
- For space stations, write name of space station if not within 100km of a celestial body.
- If not mining field, write purpose of static core, such as Main Factory, Deco Factory, Ship Shop etc.

## Mining Fields: after planet names, only for MUs
- Name of main ore collected such as: Hematite, Bauxite etc.
- Write MU after ore name to signify it is an ore extraction core.
- You may shorten ore name to first 4 letters if space is an issue.

## Unique Number: last in order
- XXX where X is the number of the ship
- 001 for the 1st ship made, 002 for the 2nd etc.

## Examples: 
#### There is a decoration factory on Haven.
`[MTI] Haven Deco Factory 001`

There are two hematite tiles on Alioth Moon 4 and a Bauxite tile.\
> `[MTI] AliothM4 Hematite MU 001`\
> `[MTI] AliothM4 Hematite MU 002`\
> `[MTI] AliothM4 Bauxite MU 001`

 There is a space station above a refuelling station near Jago. It is made from 2 cores.\
