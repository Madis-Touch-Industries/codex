# Dynamic Core Naming Convention

These are a list of codes the org names ships for org use.

## Org Codes: at the beginning of name

## Engine Codes: at the end of name

- `B` for Basic Engines
- `U` for Uncommon Engines
- `A` for Advanced
- `R` For Rare Engines
- `E` for Exotic Engines

## Ship Version: after Weapon Rarity Codes

- `Mk. X`, where the `X` is the version.

## Unique Number: last in order

- `XXX` where `X` is the number of the ship
- `001` for the 1st ship made, `002` for the 2nd etc.

Someone is flying a fourth gen Freestrike with basic engines. This was the 4th Freestrike deployed.
Their name would be:
> `[MTI] Freestrike B Mk4 004`

There are three cargo pods with 6L cargo containers and one with 3L cargo containers.
> `[MTI] 3L Cargo Pod 001`\
> `[MTI] 6L Cargo Pod 001`\
> `[MTI] 6L Cargo Pod 002`

**Note: please do not tag your personal ships with this system to remove confusion.**
