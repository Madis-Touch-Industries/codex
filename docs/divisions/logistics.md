# Logistics ðŸš€

The logistics division is responsible for moving packages back and forth for the org.

## How can I contribute?

To contribute to the org in this manner we will be posting missions exclusively for members to fly. Most of these missions will be posted for `3 days` to `1 week`.

## How can I view the missions?

To view the missions press `F8` and click the ðŸ”Ž icon.

You should see missions posted for MTI members only.
